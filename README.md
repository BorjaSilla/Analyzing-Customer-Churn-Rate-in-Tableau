# Tableau Story: Customer Churn Rate Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Tableau Story that delves into the analysis of customer churn rate. This visualization is designed to provide insights into various factors influencing customer churn within our organization. The story is divided into four pages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data.

### Page 1: Overview of Data

In this page, you'll find an overview of the key metrics related to customer churn. The visualizations will include graphs and charts depicting the overall churn rate trends, customer distribution, and a breakdown of the customer base by demographics. This section aims to set the stage for a deeper understanding of the data.

### Page 2: Age Brackets & Groups

Understanding the age demographics is crucial in identifying patterns in customer churn. This page will present visualizations that break down the churn rate across different age brackets and customer groups. By analyzing age-related trends, we aim to uncover insights into which age groups are more susceptible to churn.

### Page 3: Customer Service, Payment Method, and Contract

This page focuses on the relationship between customer service interactions, payment methods, and contract types with customer churn. The visualizations will highlight the impact of customer service quality, preferred payment methods, and contract lengths on the likelihood of churn. Identifying pain points in these areas can guide strategic efforts to improve customer retention.

### Page 4: International vs. National Plans and Unlimited Data Impact

In the final page, we explore the impact of service plans on customer churn. Visualizations will compare churn rates between international and national plans, as well as assess the influence of offering unlimited data on customer retention. This section aims to guide decision-making regarding service plan offerings and features.
